# polyphon-js — CLAUDE.md

JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for the Polyphon JSON-RPC API. Provides the canonical client, type definitions, and a mock server for testing integrations against Polyphon without a running app.

Published to npm as `@polyphon-ai/js`. Version is kept in sync with the Polyphon app version.

## Domain Vocabulary

Use the same language as the Polyphon app:

| Concept | Term |
|---|---|
| An AI agent in a session | **voice** |
| A saved multi-agent configuration | **composition** |
| A conversation thread | **session** |
| The user | **conductor** |

## Package Exports

```
@polyphon-ai/js           # Client, types, token helpers, error codes
@polyphon-ai/js/testing   # MockPolyphonServer and fixtures — import only in tests
```

## Source of Truth

**All source files in `src/` are AUTO-SYNCED from the `polyphon` repository. Do not edit them by hand.**

| File(s) | Synced from |
|---|---|
| `src/types.ts`, `src/api.ts` | `polyphon/src/shared/types.ts`, `polyphon/src/shared/api.ts` |
| `src/client.ts`, `src/errors.ts`, `src/token.ts`, `src/index.ts` | `polyphon/src/sdk/*.ts` |
| `src/testing/` | `polyphon/src/sdk/testing/` |
| `src/*.test.ts`, `src/testing/*.test.ts` | `polyphon/src/sdk/**/*.test.ts` |

The sync runs automatically via the `sync-sdk.yml` GitHub Actions workflow on each Polyphon release tag.
Tests run in `polyphon` CI first (against the real server implementation), then the synced files are
published here and to npm.

The only files native to this repo are: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.build.json`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

## Version Policy

The SDK version always matches the Polyphon app version (e.g. Polyphon `0.12.0` → SDK
`0.12.0`). This makes API compatibility unambiguous: install the SDK version that matches
your Polyphon install.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript 5 |
| Build | tsc (NodeNext ESM + declarations) |
| Testing | Vitest |
| Runtime | Node.js ≥ 18 (TCP via `node:net`) |

## Build & Development

```sh
npm install
make build        # type-check + compile to dist/ (includes dist/testing/)
make test         # run all tests
make lint         # type-check only
make verify-dist  # assert dist/testing/ exists and no *.test.js leaked into dist/
make clean        # rm -rf dist/
```

---

## Testing Policy

- Unit tests cover `PolyphonClient` in isolation using `MockPolyphonServer`
- Integration tests exercise the full client ↔ server round-trip via `MockPolyphonServer`
- `MockPolyphonServer` must implement all API methods and is the primary testing artifact
- Keep mock responses realistic — word-by-word streaming with configurable delay, not single-chunk dumps
- `@polyphon-ai/js/testing` is a published subpath export — never include `*.test.js` in `dist/`
